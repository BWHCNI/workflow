Calibration images taken on Nikon scope with both cameras on 2011.6.30.
Largest lines visible in webcam 5x are 1mm apart, next smaller 0.5mm, next 100um, next 10um.
IMPORTANT: the script uses scale bars based on an image that is 1600x1200 px (original un-scaled images in ./originals/)

5x pics 500um / 0.5mm is
webcam: 470 px
nikon 575 px

10x pics 500um is
webcam: 930 px
nikon: 1145 px
(matches 5x +/- a few px)

20x pics 100um is
webcam: 376 px
nikon: 460 px

50x and 100x objectives can't be used with that calibration slide, need to extrapolate.
Therefore:

50x pics 100um is increased by a factor of 2.5
webcam: 940 px
nikon:  1150 px

100x pics 50um is the same
webcam:  940 px
nikon:  1150 px

100	10	160	230	44%

If the error was only from going from 1x to 0.8x adaper on webcam then err is 25%???

Ting-Di's note: "(The reason why I failed to align the analysis frame to the Nikon image is 
that I choose the starting point on Nikon image while the scale bar on the Nikon image is 
much larger than the real dimension so the analysed area is a bit shifted to the left side. 
For your information, based onthe Nikon image of the Si grid, the measured dimension of 
the 200 um bar is about 275 um and the one of 100 um is around 125 um.)
